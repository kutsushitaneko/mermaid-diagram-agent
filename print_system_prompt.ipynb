      "6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n",
      "7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n",
      "8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\n",
      "9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n",
